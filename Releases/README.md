# Releases
Due to continued work on the project I will occasionally package proven versions of this project into zip files in this folder.

This will be useful for those who want a working version where as the repo will constantly be worked on which may mean that it becomes unstable / broken at some points.

I would recommend that you use the latest version for your projects.

If you would like to contribute or use this project as a starting point for your own work then please feel free to take one of these zips or fork the repo.
