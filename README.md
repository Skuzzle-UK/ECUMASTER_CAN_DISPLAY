# ECUMASTER_CAN_DISPLAY
 
Arduino project for displaying a clock and useful engine data set via CAN-BUS.

Build with ECUMASTER EMU Black in mind, but could be repurposed for any CAN-BUS system.

All data pages are currently displaying as intended. Clock works and time can be set.

CAN-BUS read function is untested as of writing.

## Project hardware:
- Arduino nano
- MCP2515 CAN-BUS SPI module.
- 128x32 OLED display
- 3 x buttons / switches
